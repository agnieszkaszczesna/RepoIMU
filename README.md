RepoIMU repository is proposed for the needs of algorithm testing on the basis of the output of IMU sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope). Quaternion coded data from optical motion capture system (Vicon Nexus) are used as a reference. Although data are from two different systems, they were synchronized and properly cropped for
the sake of user’s convenience.

Repository features:
– signals from IMU sensors (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope) synchronized with reference orientation quaternion from optical motion capture
system;
– data from two kinematic sets: wand (T-stick) and 3-segment pendulum;
– a full range of orientation angles’ changes;
– recording with different acceleration values.
